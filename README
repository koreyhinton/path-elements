DISCLAIMER

This program is in no way meant to convert filepaths to xml and vice versa,
and no guarantees given.

The purpose of this is to be able to manually type in a small amount of data
that has a tree/hierarchical structure, and store it in a path-like way for
readability purposes. These programs will allow converting between the path
form and xml form. Any weird characters will attempt to be encoded in the xml
form.

REQUIREMENTS

python 3

INFO

Every path component converted to xml gets its own xml element tag.

Everything is simply just a tag, there is not xml tag content nor xml
attributes.

EXAMPLES

The find command is a great way to quickly send test data through these
programs.

find /var -name "*" | paths2xml  # see the XML
find /var -name "*" | paths2xml | xml2paths  # convert back to PATHs

find /var -name "*" | paths2xml --compress  # see the compressed XML
find /var -name "*" | paths2xml -c  # see the compressed XML

find /var -name "*" | paths2xml | xml2paths --intermediate  # include
                                                            # intermediate paths
find /var -name "*" | paths2xml | xml2paths --i  # include intermediate paths
